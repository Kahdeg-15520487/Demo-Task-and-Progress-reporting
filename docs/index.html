# Asynchronous programming patterns
## Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)

---

# Different method for intializing and executing task.
```csharp
- Task.Run
- Task.Factory.*
- TaskCompletionSource<TResult>
```
---

# Different method for intializing and executing task.

- .bold[Task.Run], .bold[Task.Factory.*] will handle the completion of task, making sure that a task will end(completed) for any one that await it.

- .bold[TaskCompletionSource] type enables you as a developer control over a task’s lifecycle. You will be the one to say when will the task end
by calling one of the Set* or TrySet* methods on the completion source.


---

# Task's status
The .green[Task] class provides a life cycle for asynchronous operations, and that cycle is represented by the .green[TaskStatus] enumeration.
---

# TaskStatus
Status | Meaning
------ | -------
Canceled | The task is cancelled
Created | The task is created using Task's constructor but haven't been Run yet
Faulted | The task completed due to an unhandled exception.
RanToCompletion | The task completed execution successfully.
Running | The task is running but has not yet completed.
---

# Cancellation
In TAP, cancellation is .bold[optional] for both asynchronous method implementers and asynchronous method consumers.

If an operation does not allow cancellation, it's execution will continue until either it .green[Faulted] or .green[RanToCompletion].

If an operation allows cancellation, it exposes an overload of the asynchronous method that accepts a cancellation token (CancellationToken instance). 

Example:
```csharp
public Task ReadAsync(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count, 
                      CancellationToken cancellationToken)

var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
string result = await ReadAsync(buffer, offset, count, cts.Token);
… // at some point later, potentially on another thread
cts.Cancel();					  
```
---

#Progress Reporting 

Some asynchronous operations benefit from providing progress notifications.

In TAP, progress is handled through an IProgress interface, which is passed to the asynchronous method as a parameter.

Example:
```csharp
public Task ReadAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, 
                      IProgress<long> progress)
```

#Consuming the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern
---

#Suspending Execution with Await

You can use the await keyword in C# to asynchronously await Task objects.

Example:

```csharp
public Task ReadAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)

var readResult = await ReadAsync();
```
---

#Continual task
Use the overloads of the Task.ContinueWith method. This method creates a new task that is scheduled when another task completes.

Use the TaskFactory.ContinueWhenAll and TaskFactory.ContinueWhenAny methods. These methods create a new task that is scheduled when all or any of a supplied set of tasks completes.

Example:
```csharp
//a list of task
List<Task> tasks = new List<Task>();

//will be run after the task list is all completed
Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAll(tasks.ToArray(), result => {Console.WriteLine(result);});

//will be run after any task in the task list is completed
Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAny(tasks.ToArray(), result => {Console.WriteLine(result);});
```

#Other construct in TAP
---
#Task.Delay

Introduce pauses in an async method.

Such pauses will not occupy a thread and thus let other task execute.

Example: status polling task
```csharp
private async Task DoWorkAsyncInfiniteLoop()
{
    while (true)
    {
        // do the work in the loop
        string newData = DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString();

        // update the UI
        txtTicks.Text = "ASYNC LOOP - " + newData;

        // don't run again for at least 200 milliseconds
        await Task.Delay(200);
    }
}
```
---

#Task.WhenAll

Await multiple async method

Example: wait for email sending's result
```csharp
IEnumerable<Task> asyncOps = from addr in addrs select SendMailAsync(addr);
await Task.WhenAll(asyncOps);
```
---

#Task.WhenAny
Usage:
- Redundancy
- Interleaving
- Throttling
- Early bailout

---

#Task.WhenAny Redundancy
Performing an operation multiple times and selecting the one that completes first

Example: getting stock info
```csharp
var recommendations = new List<Task<bool>>()
{
    GetBuyRecommendation1Async(symbol),
    GetBuyRecommendation2Async(symbol),
    GetBuyRecommendation3Async(symbol)
};
Task<bool> recommendation = await Task.WhenAny(recommendations);

//will buy the stock according to the first to complete recommendation
if (await recommendation) BuyStock(symbol);
```
---

#Task.WhenAny Interleaving
Launching multiple operations and waiting for all of them to complete, but processing them as they complete.

Example: download and show image as soon as each image done loading
```csharp
List<Task<Bitmap>> imageTasks = (from imageUrl in urls select GetBitmapAsync(imageUrl)).ToList();
while(imageTasks.Count > 0)
{
    try
    {
        Task<Bitmap> imageTask = await Task.WhenAny(imageTasks);
        imageTasks.Remove(imageTask);

        Bitmap image = await imageTask;
        panel.AddImage(image);
    }
    catch{}
}
```
---

#Task.WhenAny Throttling
Launching multiple operations but only allow a limited amount of operation to run at the same time.
---

#Task.WhenAny Early bailout
For example, an operation represented by task .bold[T1] can be grouped in a .bold[WhenAny] task with another task .bold[T2], and you can wait on the .bold[WhenAny] task. 

Task .bold[T2] could represent a .bold[time-out], or .bold[cancellation], or some other signal that causes the .bold[WhenAny] task to complete before .bold[T1] completes.
---

#Task.WhenAny Early bailout
Example: User want to download image, have the image display as soon as it is loaded, but also is able to cancel image download.
```csharp
//use a CancellationToken to control execution of the cancel task
private CancellationTokenSource m_cts;

public void btnCancel_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	//cancel the CancellationToken
    m_cts?.Cancel();
}
```
---

#Task.WhenAny Early bailout
```csharp
public async void btnRun_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    m_cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
    btnRun.Enabled = false;
    try
    {
		//get the work task
        Task<Bitmap> imageDownload = GetBitmapAsync(txtUrl.Text);
		
		//await its completion and also give it the CancellationToken
        await UntilCompletionOrCancellation(imageDownload, m_cts.Token);
        if (imageDownload.IsCompleted)
        {
            Bitmap image = await imageDownload;
            panel.AddImage(image);
        }
        else imageDownload.ContinueWith(t => Log(t));
    }
    finally { btnRun.Enabled = true; }
}
```
---

#Task.WhenAny Early bailout
```csharp
private static async Task UntilCompletionOrCancellation(
    Task asyncOp, CancellationToken ct)
{
	//use TaskCompletionSource to control the task's lifecycle
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();
	//register an action to be run when cancellationToken is cancelled
	//that action being complete the async task
    using(ct.Register(() => tcs.TrySetResult(true))){
        await Task.WhenAny(asyncOp, tcs.Task);
	}
    return asyncOp;
}
```
---

#Task.WhenAny Early bailout
There is a problem with this pattern.

.bold[Know when you’ve passed the point of no cancellation]

Don’t cancel if you’ve already incurred .bold[side-effects] that your method isn’t prepared to revert on the way out that would leave you in an inconsistent state.

So if you’ve done some work, and have a lot more to do, and the token is cancelled, you must only cancel when and if you can do so leaving objects in a valid state.
